These are the files used to create my website "james.host20.uk"

Using HTMl, CSS, PHP, mySQL and a little bit of Javascript, hosted on thecompletewebhosting.com, which i got free from a Udemy course

Ive uploaded them, as a backup, but also to show how it was made to anyone interested!

Thanks for reading :)
